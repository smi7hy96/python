# INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON

## Basic Principles of Python

- print()
    - This method can return any variables or data type and display them in the output console

- type()
    - This will return the data type of a variable into the output console

- input()
    - this will allow the user to type into the console and will wait on this line until the user is done typing. This can be stored into a variable to be used later

- variables
    - This is where data types can be stored and used later on in the code. It becomes a placeholder for the data stored within it

- data types - 
    - Strings - Combination of characters, wrapped in " "
    - Int -  Whole number ie. 6
    - Floats- A decimal number ie. 9.52
    - BOOLEAN - True or False
