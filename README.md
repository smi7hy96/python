# INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON

## Basic Principles of Python

- print()
    - This method can return any variables or data type and display them in the output console

- type()
    - This will return the data type of a variable into the output console

- input()
    - this will allow the user to type into the console and will wait on this line until the user is done typing. This can be stored into a variable to be used later

- variables
    - This is where data types can be stored and used later on in the code. It becomes a placeholder for the data stored within it

- data types - 
    - Strings - Combination of characters, wrapped in " "
    - Int -  Whole number ie. 6
    - Floats- A decimal number ie. 9.52
    - BOOLEAN - True or False
    
- OBJECT ORIENTATED PROGRAMMING (OOP)
    - Abstraction
        - Showing users only relevant information and hiding unimportant information that the user doesn't need to see
    
    - Encapsulation 
        - Keeps functions and methods separate from other data and segments of code. So that if something needs modifying, only the function of it needs updating. the rest of the code will be unaffected by the changes.
    
    - Inheritance
        - This is when Classes have access to the function from other Classes above them. For example, a Person class could have attributes such as name and address. A second class, for an Employee could inherit those attributes as well as have their own; such as location and job role.
        - The Parent Class would be Person; and Employee would be the Child Class.
        - Inheritance can happen between multiple classes and have multiple layers. (hierarchical and multiple inheritance)
        
    - Polymorphism
        - This is allowing a method/ function/ variable etc. to be used in more than one way/form.
            - For example; a method could take a variable and depending on its type the function will perform different actions ie. have more than one form.
